The Monarch knowledge graph is a reference implementation of the Biolink model specification. It contains data from the Monarch Initiative aggregated database, as well as several OBO ontologies. These data sources provide links between diseases, phenotypes, genomic features across human and non-human organisms. It is built using the knowledge graph exchange (KGX) framework, which transforms a variety of standard formats, such as RDF, OWL, and TRAPI JSON, to nodes and edges CSV files that are uploaded into Neo4j. The TRAPI API (https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/ReasonerAPI) is built using PLATER (https://github.com/NCATSTranslator/Translator-All/wiki/Plater), a tool that creates a TRAPI service given a Biolink compliant instance of Neo4j.

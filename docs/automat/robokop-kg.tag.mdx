ROBOKOP (KG) is an open-source biomedical KG that supports the ROBOKOP application and currently contains millions of biomedical relationships derived from dozens of integrated and harmonized biological knowledge sources and bio-ontologies, including the Automat primary and aggregate knowledge sources. ROBOKOP KG also includes text-mined assertions from PubMed and PubMed Central, derived from natural language processing (NLP). Note that text-based assertions, while providing valuable information, must be interpreted with caution, as NLP algorithms may introduce false assertions.

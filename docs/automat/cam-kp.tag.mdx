CAMs (Causal Activity Models) are small knowledge graphs built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The CAM database combines many CAM graphs along with a large merged bio-ontology containing the full vocabulary of concepts referenced within the individual CAMs. Each CAM describes an instantiation of some of those concepts in a particular context, modeling the interactions between those instances as an interlinked representation of a complex biological or environmental process.

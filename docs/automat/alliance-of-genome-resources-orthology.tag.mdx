The Alliance of Genome Resources is a consortium of 7 model organism databases (MODs) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium whose goal is to provide an integrated view of their data to all biologists, clinicians and other interested parties. The Alliance provides the results of all methods that have been benchmarked by the Quest for Orthologs Consortium (QfO), as well as curated ortholog inferences from HGNC (for human, mouse and rat genes).

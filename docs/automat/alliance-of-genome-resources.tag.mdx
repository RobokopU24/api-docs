The Alliance of Genome Resources is a consortium of the owners of seven model organism databases (MODs) and the Gene Ontology (GO) Consortium, whose goal is to provide an integrated view of their data to all biologists, clinicians, and other interested parties. The Alliance provides the results of all methods that have been benchmarked by the Quest for Orthologs Consortium (QfO), as well as curated ortholog inferences from HGNC (human, mouse, rat genes).

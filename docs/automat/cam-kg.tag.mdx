The CAM KG contains data on CAMs (Causal Activity Models), which are small knowledge graphs built using the Web Ontology Language (OWL). The CAM database combines many CAM graphs, along with a large merged bio-ontology containing the full vocabulary of concepts referenced within the individual CAMs. Each CAM describes an instantiation of some of those concepts in a particular context, modeling the interactions between those instances as an interlinked representation of a complex biological or environmental process.
